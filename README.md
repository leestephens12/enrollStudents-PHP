# Assignment1
My project is a student database for schools, in which you input the students information(Firstname, lastname, student number, and year of study) in order to enroll them for the semester.
I have validation on my code so all fields must be filled out before continuing. For the student number I have applied extra steps so that the student number must be 7 digits long to ensure that it is valid, if it is not then you cannot proceed.
Finally, My last page contains a table that allows you to view all the information in the database in an organized manner.
As well I have added some extra links throughout the website that will make it easier to navigate.
